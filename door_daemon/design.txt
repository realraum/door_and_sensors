# notes about the design of door_deamon

door_daemon is executed on torwaechter under openwrt with procd.
To unwrap, this means:
  - this daemon is executed with service supervision
  - is restarted an unlimited number of times if it exites with a
        wait time of 2s between restarts
  - on most errors that do not require to keep state it's better to
        just exist
        IFF for whatever reason it's required to keep state across
        errors, this design decission should be reconsidered
