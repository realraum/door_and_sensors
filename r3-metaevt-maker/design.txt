This daemon should furthermore be the only one ! to regexp parse door firmware string messages, door command string messages and sensor string notices from different sources.
Thus this should be the only place we have to change code when regular expressions change or new sources are added or ip addresses change.
The data is then exported as go-struct like events. Internally (to add i.e. presence) and externally via 0mq pub
Thus the same events are usable in different services written in different languages
(instead of just one language where we could import a common library for regexp parsing again and again)
