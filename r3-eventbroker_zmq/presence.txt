Presence Meta Event Injector:
    events indicating presence:
    - front door ajar
    - door lock using manual movement closing (unless door ajar, assume we would not use key to close from inside )
    - door unlock (any method, manual, key, card, phone, ssh, etc)
    - panic button press
    - door toggle button press
    - back door ajar
    - movement sensor (maybe threshold number movements within 5 minutes)

    events indicating somebody left:
    - door closed with card, phone, ssh (while backdor and frontdoor shut)
    - no movement within 3 hours and movement within the last 6 hours (disable trigger if sensor is broken)
    

    events indicating "alarm state" / special message:
    - Panic Button pressend
    - Sudden rise in Temp-Sensor-Value
    - Sudden rise in Dust/Smoke-Sensor-Value


Movement Meta Event Injector:
    movement sensor (maybe threshold number movements within 5 minutes) -> Movement Passed Threshold
    no movement within 3 hours and movement within the last 6 hours -> Movement Absence Passed Threshold

Sensor Spike Event Injector:
    monitors sensor values and calculates running average mean, stddev over last hours,
    raises Event is value spikes, aka rised beyond mean +- stddev within 2 min (enables after 1 hour of collecting data)
  


Use Cases to detect:
* someone walks by the movement sensor towards the door. Closes it from outside with the Card and leaves -> nobody in room anymore
* somone still works in the OLGA room while the last person in the main room leaves and closes the door behind him with the card

-> best idea so far:
 -> all doors closed and shut -> no movement for ~30 seconds after closing doors -> assume everybody left
                                               -> movement within next ~30 seconds -> assume somebody is still here until SomthingReallyIsMoving{false} fires
                                               

possible better Solution:
  close door "differently" from outside if people are still inside (e.g. with buttonpress prior to closing with card from outside... or install a "CLOSE ONLY" event sending device which can be triggered through the glass)
