Presence Meta Event Injector:
    events indicating presence:
    - front door ajar
    - door lock using manual movement closing (unless door ajar, assume we would not use key to close from inside )
    - door unlock (any method, manual, key, card, phone, ssh, etc)
    - panic button press
    - door toggle button press
    - back door ajar
    - movement sensor (maybe threshold number movements within 5 minutes)

    events indicating somebody left:
    - door closed with card, phone, ssh (while backdor and frontdoor shut)
    - no movement within 3 hours and movement within the last 6 hours (disable trigger if sensor is broken)

    events indicating "alarm state" / special message:
    - Panic Button pressend
    - Sudden rise in Temp-Sensor-Value
    - Sudden rise in Dust/Smoke-Sensor-Value


Movement Meta Event Injector:
    movement sensor (maybe threshold number movements within 5 minutes) -> Movement Passed Threshold
    no movement within 3 hours and movement within the last 6 hours -> Movement Absence Passed Threshold

Sensor Spike Event Injector:
    monitors sensor values and calculates running average mean, stddev over last hours,
    raises Event is value spikes, aka rised beyond mean +- stddev within 2 min (enables after 1 hour of collecting data)
